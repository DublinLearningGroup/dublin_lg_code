This mini-project mainly serves as a reminder for the basic steps
involved in doing survival analysis in R.

The data provided is randomly generated data for a book of life
insurance protection polices and their status.

The code is provided in RMarkdown format. To render it, the following
code should work. Please note that the markdown expects a number of R
packages to be installed, see the markdow for details.

         library(rmarkdown)
         render("SurvivalAnalysisInR.Rmd")

A pre-rendered notebook including the code and output is included in
this repository.
